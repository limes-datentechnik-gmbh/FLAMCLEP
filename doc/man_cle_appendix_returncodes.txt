Below you can find the return codes of the program. These values are
also called completion codes and returned at program termination.
This content is printed on the screen with the built-in function
'ERRORS'.

 * 0  - command line, command syntax, mapping, execution and finish of the command was successful
 * 2  - command line, command syntax, mapping, execution was successful but finish of the command failed
 * 4  - command line, command syntax and mapping was successful but execution of the command returns with a warning
 * 8  - command line, command syntax and mapping was successful but execution of the command returns with an error
 * 12 - command line and command syntax was OK but mapping failed
 * 16 - command line was OK but command syntax was wrong
 * 20 - command line was wrong (user error)
 * 24 - initialization is wrong (user error)
 * 28 - configuration is wrong (user error)
 * 32 - table error (something within the predefined tables is wrong)
 * 36 - system error (mainly memory allocation or some thing like this failed)
 * 40 - access control or license error
 * 64 - fatal error (basic things are damaged)
 
A command execution (run) can result in a return code of 0 on success,
a warning represent by value 4 or an error with value 8. If the command
execution was successful (return code 0) then a return code of 2
indicates that a call to the finish function failed. Such a fail of the
finish function is not recognize if the run function returns with a
warning or an error. All completion codes greater then 8 indicates an
error in front of the command execution.
