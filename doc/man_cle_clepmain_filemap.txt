All filenames used by CLEP are additionally mapped based on the rules
below:

* The tilde character (`~`) is replaced with the string "<HOME>"
* DD names on mainframes must be prefixed with "DD:"
* Data set names on mainframes are always full qualified
* Path names on mainframes must contain a least one slash (`/`)
* Data set names on USS must start with //
** Full qualified names with HLQ must enclose in apostrophes ("//''")
** If apostrophes are not used the SYSUID is prefixed as HLQ
* Normal file names on other platforms could be relative

*ATTENTION:* If a requested environment variable is not defined, the
replacement is done with the empty string. This can result in
unexpected behavior.

To use a "<" or "~" as a part of a filename the character must be
specified twice.

Beside this rules the replacement technologies of your shell can be used,
but on some platforms $HOME, $USER or something similar might not
be available, for such cases the possibilities above are implemented.

This file name mapping is provided by the library CLEPUTL and should
also be used for file names managed by the commands supported with this
program.
