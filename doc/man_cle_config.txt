The actual configuration list with owner id, property file names trace
setting, environment variables and more are shown. With the option CLEAR
the configuration data including the corresponding file will be deleted.

The configuration file can be defined by the environment variable:

   program_CONFIG_FILE=config.file.name
   
If this location not defined, then the configuration file are stored on
distributed systems in the current home directory under the file
name:

   .program.config
   
If no home directory defined for the current user, then the working
directory is used.

On mainframes as default the data set name 'SYSUID.program.CONFIG' is
used. SYSUID as high level qualifier is a kind of replacement for the
current home directory on distributed system in this case.
