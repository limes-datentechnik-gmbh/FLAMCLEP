The actual configuration list with owner id, property file names trace
setting, environment variables and more are shown. With the option CLEAR
the configuration data including the corresponding file will be deleted.

The configuration file name can be defined by the environment variable:

   &{PGM}_CONFIG_FILE=config.file.name
   
This can be used to work with a global configuration file. If this
location not defined, then the configuration file are stored on
distributed systems in the current home directory under the file
name:

   .&{pgm}.config
   
If no home directory defined  for the current user (this case is very
improbable), then the working directory is used.

To read the configuration file and the environment variable above is not
defined, CLE looks first in the working and then in the home directory.
This enables you to prefer a property file, by coping it to the current 
working directory.

On mainframes as default the data set name 'SYSUID.&{PGM}.CONFIG' is
used. SYSUID as high level qualifier is a kind of replacement for the
current home directory on distributed system in this case.
