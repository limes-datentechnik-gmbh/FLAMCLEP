This built-in function generates the complete user manual in HTML format
into a folder. The folder can be defined as optional parameter. If no
path given, then the current directory is used as default.

With the optional keyword `NUMBERS` the numbering of headlines can be
activated. The keyword `TYPE` add the type information to each generated
headline. The keyword `SHORT` will result in a short version of the
document, not containing the parameter of the commands and other CLP
strings.

In opposite to the built-in function <<CLEP.BUILTIN.GENDOCU,GENDOCU>> at
HTML generation no path is written to the synopsis but index terms are
generated by default.

The built-in function can only be used if a call back function for HTML
documentation provided. If not a error will be issued if HTMLDOC is
executed. The callback function is called for each prepared page and the
unique pointer to the original manual string can be used to determine if
this page already created and if so then only a link to this existing
page is required. This interface allows to generated more flexible (with
dictionary, index, search) and redundancy free HTML documentation.

To understand the service provider interface (open, close and callback
function) for HTML generation see the DOXYGEN documentation of
FLAMCLE/CLP.h
