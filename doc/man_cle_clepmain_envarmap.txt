If the environment variable not defined the replacements below are still
possible:

* <SYSUID> - Current user id in upper case
* <USER>   - Current user id (case sensitive)
* <CUSER>  - Current user id in upper case == <SYSUID>
* <Cuser>  - Current user id in title case
* <cuser>  - Current user id in lower case
* <HOME>   - Replaces with the users data directory, if this not
               available the replacements below are done:
** On UNIX with /home/<USER>
** On USS with /u/<USER>
** On ZOS with <SYSUID>

Additional few abbreviation are supported for different kind of strings.

* '~' for <HOME> in file strings
* '!' for <ENVID> in key labels
* '~' for <SYSUID> in key labels
* '^' for <OWNERID> in key labels

All these abbreviation character have different code points in EBCDIC
code pages and can only be used if the CCSID known be CLP, see chapter
<<CLEP.MAIN.EBCDIC,special EBCDIC code page support>> how the CCSID can
