Each value enclosed with angle brackets (`<>`) are replaced with the
corresponding environment variable (`<LANG>`). This feature is available
at each starting point of a lexeme and inside of a normal string.

If the environment variable not defined the replacements below are still
possible:

* <SYSUID> - Current user id in upper case
* <USER>   - Current user id (case sensitive)
* <CUSER>  - Current user id in upper case == <SYSUID>
* <Cuser>  - Current user id in title case
* <cuser>  - Current user id in lower case
* <HOME>   - Replaces with the users data directory, if this not
               available the replacements below are done:
** On UNIX with /home/<USER>
** On USS with /u/<USER>
** On ZOS with <SYSUID>
