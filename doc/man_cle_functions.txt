Numerous built-in functions are available to obtain extensive help
about syntax, errors, commands and functions of a program with help
messages, manual pages and documentation.

Other built-in functions can be used for owner, property, environment
and trace management. All built-in functions have the purpose to
simplify handling of powerful and sometimes complex commands.

The command line executer gets the program name (for example "flcl" for
frankenstein limes command line) as parameter. Means the description of
the built-in functions don't know the final program name which use the 
FLAMCLEP to handle a command line interpretation. Based on this in the
description of the built-in function the variable program name are 
propagated in a neutral form called 'program'. The 'program' qualifier
must be replaced by the real program name (flcl) to use the examples and
syntax correctly.
