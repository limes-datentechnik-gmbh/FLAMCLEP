The file name is set as current global property file when no command is
specified. The file name is set as current local property file when a
command is given. The property file can be generated with GENPROP and
will be activated for the current owner.

After generation you can activate the property file, but there will be
no effect until you change the settings inside the property file,
because the current default settings are written.

See <<appendix-properties>> for the current property file content.
