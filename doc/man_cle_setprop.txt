The file name is set as current global property file when no command is
specified. The file name is set as current local property file when a
command is given. The property file can be generated with GENPROP and
will be activated for the current owner.

After generation you can activate the property file, but there will be
no effect until you change the settings inside the property file,
because the current default settings are written.

Do not use space characters between the key, assignment character (=)
and filename.


We recommend to work only with command specific property files, because
the built-in function CHGPROP can be used to generate, update and 
activate a property file for a certain command.

See <<appendix-properties>> for the current property file content.
