This command line parser provides a list of commands and some
built-in functions, please use 'MANPAGE', 'HELP' and 'SYNTAX' to get
extensive information about these capabilities.

Additional You can use the build-in function'GENDOCU' to generate a
complete or parts of the user manual.

To read the parameter of a command, a compiler is applied.
To see the regular expressions (lexems) and the corresponding
grammar, please use the build in functions 'LEXEM' and 'GRAMMAR'.

The command line parser uses an owner management in order to separate
the settings for different clients and a property management for each
command. If problems occur, you can activate a trace and manage all
configuration settings.

For each command execution You can define environment variables which
are managed over the config file.

The default trace file is 'stdout'. If you activate the trace befor a
trace file is defined, the trace will be printed on the screen.

Last but not least you can determine license, version and other
information about the program.

This is the ${__BUILD__} build version of the FLAMCLEP.
