The COMMAND LINE PROCESSOR (CLEP) is a user application programming
interface for several platforms including Windows, Unix and z/OS that
simplifies and standardizes parameter string processing.

The CLEP provides two separate functions:

* COMMAND LINE PARSER (CLP)   - Compiles a parameter string from a command to a data structure
* COMMAND LINE EXECUTOR (CLE) - Supporting execution of different commands with parameter strings

The COMMAND LINE EXECUTOR provides a list of commands and some
built-in functions, please use <<CLEP.BUILTIN.MANPAGE,MANPAGE>>,
<<CLEP.BUILTIN.HELP,HELP>> and <<CLEP.BUILTIN.SYNTAX,SYNTAX>> to get
extensive information about these capabilities.

Additionally the built-in function <<CLEP.BUILTIN.GENDOCU,GENDOCU>> can
generate a complete or a part of the user manual.

To read the parameter of a command, a compiler (CLP) is applied. To see
the regular expressions (lexemes) and the corresponding grammar, please
use the built-in functions <<CLEP.BUILTIN.LEXEMES,LEXEMES>> and
<<CLEP.BUILTIN.GRAMMAR,GRAMMAR>>.

The return/condition/exit codes of the executable and the reason codes
of the different commands can be reviewed with the built-in function
<<CLEP.BUILTIN.ERRORS,ERRORS>>.
See sections <<CLEP.APPENDIX.RETURNCODES,return codes>> and, if available,
<<CLEP.APPENDIX.REASONCODES,reason codes>> for the meaning of the
used return and reason codes.

The CLE uses an owner management in order to separate the settings for
different clients and a property management for each command. If problems
occur, a trace might be activated.

For each command execution the owner and environment variables can be
defined in the configuration file. To see the current configuration use
the built-in function <<CLEP.BUILTIN.CONFIG,CONFIG>>.

The default trace file is 'stdout'. If the trace is activated before a
trace file is defined, the trace will be printed on the screen. To manage
the tracing use built-in function <<CLEP.BUILTIN.TRACE,TRACE>>.

Last but not least it is possible to view the license, version and other
information about the program.

This is the &{STATE} build version of the FLAMCLEP.
