The COMMAND LINE PROCESSOR (CLEP) is a user application programming
interface for several platforms including Windows, Unix and z/OS that
simplifies and standardizes parameter string processing.

The CLEP provides two separate functions:

 * COMMAND LINE PARSER (CLP)   - Compiles a parameter string from a command to a data structure
 * COMMAND LINE EXECUTOR (CLE) - Supporting execution of different commands with parameter strings

The COMMAND LINE EXECUTOR provides a list of commands and some
built-in functions, please use 'MANPAGE', 'HELP' and 'SYNTAX' to get
extensive information about these capabilities.

Additionally the build-in function 'GENDOCU' can generate a complete or
a part of the user manual.

To read the parameter of a command, a compiler (CLP) is applied. To see
the regular expressions (lexems) and the corresponding grammar, please
use the built-in functions 'LEXEM' and 'GRAMMAR'.

The return/condition/exit codes of the executable and the reason codes
of the different commands can be reviewed with the built-in function
'ERRORS'.
See <<appendix-Returncodes,'appendix-Returncodes'>> and, if available, 
<<appendix-Reasoncodes, appendix-Reasoncodes>> 
for the meaning of the used return and reason codes.

The CLE uses an owner management in order to separate the settings for
different clients and a property management for each command. If
problems occur, a trace might be activated.

For each command execution the owner and environment variables can be
defined in the configuration file.

The default trace file is 'stdout'. If the trace is activated before a
trace file is defined, the trace will be printed on the screen.

Last but not least it is possible to view the license, version and other
information about the program.

This is the ${__BUILD__} build version of the FLAMCLEP.
