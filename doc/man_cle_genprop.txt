A property file is generated for all commands if only a filename
is provided. If a command is specified, a property file for this
specific command is created. Property files can be used to define
default settings for commands. For each parameter, a property entry is
written to a text file. The text file contains comments to help in
editing the properties. A property file can be activated with the
built-in function SETPROP.

Property files will be activated by their owner. A specific property
file overrules the general property file. At time of generation all
current default settings are written to the property file.

We recommend to work only with command specific property files, because
the built-in function CHGPROP can be used to generate, update and 
activate a property file for a certain command.

Don't use spaces between the command, the sign and the filename.

To optimize the program performance, one can remove all unnecessary
properties.

See <<appendix-properties>> for the current property file content.
