A property file is generated for all commands when only a filename
is given. If a command is specified a property file for this command
will be made. Property files can be used to define default settings for
commands. For each parameter a property entry is written to a text
file. At the beginning of the text file are elucidation to help in
editing the setting of properties. A property file can be activated
with the built-in function SETPROP.
Property files will be activated by their owner. A specific property
file overrules the general property file. At time of generation all
current default settings are written to the property file.

To optimize the program performance one can remove all unnecessary
properties.

See <<appendix-properties>> for the current property file content.
