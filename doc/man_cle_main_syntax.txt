Below you can see the main syntax for this program. This content is
printed on the screen if the built-in function 'SYNTAX' is used.

Each command can be entered as an argument list on the command line or
in a parameter file. To define a parameter file the assignment character
'=' must be used. For an argument list a blank or if the command
(main table) is of type overlay a dot '.' or if the command is of type
object a round bracket open '(' must be given. If the round bracket open
is used then the corresponding round bracket close ')' at the end of the
command is mandatory. The dot and parenthesis are in accordance with
the normal syntax.

If an argument list is used all parameters (argv[]) are concatenated
to one long string and this string is passed to the parser, to allow
usage of all features of the shell to build the command line input. To
make sure that anything you enter is passed one by one to the parser
please use double (WINDOWS(R), UNIX) or single (z/OS(R)) quotation marks
at the beginning and end of the argument list. If the dot '.' or
parenthesis '(' ')' is used the complete command can be included in
double quotation marks. The examples below show all possible command
entries for the type object:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
program command temp() dummy='str'
program command(temp() dummy='str')
program command "temp() dummy='str'"
program "command(temp() dummy='str')"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

For a command of type overlay it looks like:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
program command temp()
program command.temp()
program command "temp()"
program "command.temp()"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In a parameter file you can start with a dot for an overlay or
with parenthesis for an object or with the argument (overlay) or
argument list (object) directly.
