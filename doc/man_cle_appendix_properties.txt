[[appendix-Properties]]
All properties can be written to a global property file with the
built-in function:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   'GENPROP filename'.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
A property file for a certain command can be generated with:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   'GENPROP command=filename'
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first command shows the valid root path for the property file. A
property file can contain properties for more than one root path. The
property file parser will only interpret properties where the root
matches, i.e. if the property file is assigned to a certain owner and
possibly to a certain command, then only properties for this owner, the
program itself and possibly the command will be accepted, all other
properties are ignored.

The second long comment gives some help for handling a property
file. Thereafter the generated properties for this root are listed
for all supported commands. The format is:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   path = SUPPLEMENT # Type: tttttt Help: hhh...hhh #
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The path denotes the unique dotted keyword list for one argument. The
'SUPPLEMENT' is a string normally in double quotation marks containing
the value list for this argument in accordance with the syntax of the
command line parser (strings then normally in single quotation marks,
a opposite usage of the quotation marks is possible but not
recommended). This means for example that a string that requires
apostrophes must be included in apostrophes `("'...'")`. The supplement
string is returned by the corresponding command line parser if no value
for this argument is entered on the command line or is included in the
parameter file.

Behind the property definition the type and help message are printed as
comment to help in editing the generated property file. The property
values can be related to the current default settings at time of
generation, what means that if hard coded default values or another
property file is already in use, then these values are taken over
into the new property file.

The property file can contain parameter which are not available on the
command line. Such parameter are only documented in the property file.
On the other side not all command line parameter are available as
property.

If a description for a property argument is available which is not a
part of the user manual this description is written as comment in
front of the corresponding property definition.

Below you can see the documentation of all parameter which are only
available as property followed by all defined default properties
in form of a sample property file for all available commands.
