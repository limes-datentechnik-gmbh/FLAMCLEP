This built-in function prints explanations for the return/condition/exit
codes of the executable and, if available, the reason codes of executed
commands.

The command line executer (CLE) initialized the CLP structure. Calls the
command line processor (CLP). Calls the mapping function, which converts
the CLP structure in a corresponding command structure. Then it runs the
command and as last step it calls the finish function with the command
structure, to close all files and free all the allocated memory. If one
of these steps fails, then a corresponding return (condition/exit) code
is given back from the executable. Only the command execution can result
in a error (return code 8) or in a warning (return code 4). The command
it self must return a reason code for such a warning or error. This
means that the return (condition/exit) code can be used to control the
batch processing. The reason code gives more information about the error
or warning.

See <<appendix-returncodes>> and <<appendix-reasoncodes>> for an
explanation and the output of this command.
