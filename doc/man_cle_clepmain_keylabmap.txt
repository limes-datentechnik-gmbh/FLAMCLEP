[[clep.main.keylabmap]]
The key label name mapping works like the file name mapping, but you can
additional use `^` to replace it with the OWNERID (`^=<ONWERID>`), `!`
to replace it with the environment identifier (`!=<ENVID>`) and `~` is
only replaced with login user id. If the environment ID not defined then
`T` for test is used by default.
