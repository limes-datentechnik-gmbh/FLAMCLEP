Below you can see the grammar used by the command line compiler. This
content is printed on the screen if the built-in function 'GRAMMAR'
is used.

There are two context free grammars, one is used for the command
line the other for the parameter file. The parameter file contains
the same argument list as the command line. The property file defines
the default settings. For this a different grammar is applied.

Properties can be set for each argument, i.e. for arguments
not used or arguments in overlays. Based on that, properties are set
by using the path (dotted keyword list).

A property is always a 'SUPPLEMENT' for the argument list on the
command line or parameter file. Thus all defined properties have the
same effect as arguments on the command line. A property sets this
argument to the corresponding value if it is not defined on the
command line.
