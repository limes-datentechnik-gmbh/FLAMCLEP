Description
-----------

With the command line executor (FLAMCLE), you can simply realize a complex
command line through the definition of some tables. No programming is
required to get the values parsed and stored in a free defined data
structure.

For this to work, a compiler with its own language was implemented, to
provide the same command line interface on each available platform. This
command line parser (FLAMCLP) is used by the FLAMCLE. Both components
provide extensive help for each command and many other support functions.

For a provided list of commands, the FLAMCLE uses a dedicated command
line processor (CLP) to make all these commands available, together with
several built-in functions.

To achieve this, a table must be defined where each row describes one
command. This table provides the input for the execution function doing
the command line interpretation. The whole library consists of only one
function and a structure to define the command table.

Beside the specified user-defined commands, the FLAMCLE provides several
powerful built-in functions (listed below). All built-in functions have
a manual page, implemented to display more information at runtime.

Based on the keyword, the short help message and the detailed
description, the built-in function GENDOCU can be used to generate a
complete user manual. Based on this capability the FLAMCLE completely
describes itself.

The self-documenting style of the whole program was one of the main
targets of this general command line interface. To understand the
interface specification, it is recommended to also read the FLAMCLP
documentation.

Features
--------

Below, you can find a possibly incomplete list of FLAMCLE feature:

 * * Support of an unlimited amount of commands
 * * Support of hidden commands (not documented)
 * * Includes a lot of useful built-in functions
 * * Simple owner management to differentiate configurations
 * * The logical program name can be freely defined
 * * Case sensitive or in-sensitive command line interpretation
 * * Output file can be defined (stdout, stderr, or a real file)
 * * Complete trace file management for FLAMCLP and commands
 * * The look and feel can be defined freely
 * * Syntax, help and manpage support for program, commands and arguments
 * * Extensive documentation generation in ASCIIDOC format for the user manual
 * * Powerful property file management (generation, activation, ...)
 * * Simple configuration data management (own environment variables)
 * * Automatic keyword shortening for arguments
 * * Support for many data types, like:
 *   * Number (decimal, hexadecimal, octal, binary and time)
 *   * Float (decimal in all variants)
 *   * String (binary text/ASCII/EBCDIC/HEX or zero terminated)
 *   * Object (Structure)
 *   * Overlay (Union)
 *   * Array (List (realized as simplified notation))
 * * Support of constant definitions used as selection of values over keywords
 * * Internal calculated values are available as link (amount of values in an array, length of a string, object identifier in overlays, ...)
 * * The main table for a command can be defined as object or overlay
 * * Keyword, help message and detailed description can be freely defined for the program, each command, argument or constant definition
 * * Aliases for each argument can also be defined and are handled as options for the same value.
 * * Available and usable on each platform including WIN, UNIX, MAC, ZOS, VSE, ...
